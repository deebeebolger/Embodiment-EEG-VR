// ChannelTrial_QualityCheck-Tool.        28-05-2018

This folder contains the script and functions required to run a tool that allows the user to asses visually the quality of data.
It works for both segmented and continuous data, although it was conceived more for segmented data to help the user decide if 
certain channels should be removed or if it is better to remove certain noisy trials.
To run the tool, type the following in the Matlab command window:
EpochChan_dlg.

This will open a dialogue box allowing the user to specify certain parameters such as a threshold amplitude value in mV (default 80 but I generally use 75), number of channels to consider (default is all, including externals but I generally specify just the 64 head electrodes).

It uses a robust z-score.
